# hello-world

Where I post links, conversations, a biography of me.

I am interested in cooperative working, coding in Ruby and Python and I generally like learning new stuff.
I'd like to create my own programming language, Ember, a prototype, object-oriented and very simple language.

I'm actually not really good at coding in any language because I always prefer testing different languages and seeing my favorite (I always keep searching and I never really bury myself in some language).
